<p>The ‘Cultural Triangle’ is the heart of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry; A trail of ancient, ruined cities winding its way through the plateaus and woodland of the country’s central region. It begins in Kandy before heading north to the painted caves of Dambulla, the hill fortress of Sigiriya (which many Sri Lankans refer to as the ‘8th wonder of the world’) and ending in the vast, crumbling ruins of Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura. Tourists and pilgrims flock in their thousands each year to marvel at these wonders but often overlook what I consider the most beautiful spot in the whole of Sri Lanka; Pidurangala Rock.</p>

<p class="k">Like its more famous brother, Sigirya, Pidurangala is a huge rocky outcrop protruding from the jungle. It is as if a giant has just plucked a boulder from elsewhere and placed it in the relatively flat surroundings of central Sri Lanka. In fact, It is the remains of a hardened magma plug from an extinct volcano that has long since eroded, just leaving its solid centre behind. It is thought that the monastery here dates back to the reign of King Kassapa who displaced the monks of Sigirya to make space for his royal palace – as compensation, they were relocated to Pidurangala and provided with a temple. </p>
